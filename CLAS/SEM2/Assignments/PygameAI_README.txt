----Pygame With SchoolAI Assigment----


--Controls:
    Use the arrow keys to move left and right.
    Use the space bar to jump

--Goal:
    Move around the level and collect all the gold tokens to win.


--Peer Feedback:
    Slow down side to side movement --> decreased movement seed from '5' to '2'


--AI Experience:
    The AI was very useful for quick coding without me having to remember or learn new things to get a rough draft running.
    A limitation I ran into was that when implementing a feature that works with a current feature, the current one was often not integreated correctly with the new one.
