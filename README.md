# Welcome to my personal _Python dumping ground_

Hello! If you're reading this then you've obviously stumbled upon my repository of random Python bullshit.

This started as just the project files for my High school Sophomore year Computer Programing 1 & 2 class, that at some point I decided to turn into a GitHub repository so I could access the files when I needed, on both my laptop I take to school and my home desktop, while also making it easier to share anything cool with my friends.

Slowly though, it just turned into the dumping ground for any sort of programming project I wanted to started. You can even see that all the work for my class is now just in the folder "COMP_PROG_CLAS" and everything outside of that is a personal project that I decided to make for pure enjoyment of the activity and a idea of something cool.

In this repository you'll find everything thing from a simple cycle-step encryption algorithm that I made while re-watching "Marvel's: Agent's Of SHIELD" (Hence the files being called project MONOLITH, and ROZLAND, and DIRE, ifykyk) to the latest exploration of the PANDAS library as I fuck with the excel sheet of my work schedule that our shift scheduling system gives me.

Feel free to poke around and see what random ass shit you'll find!
